Mediafilter
===========

This Drupal module adds a filter form to Media module 7.x-1.x to handle webs with large amount of images

Based on http://cheppers.com/blog/create-custom-browser-widget-media-module

My customization of cheppers code consists of:
1) Brand new text input to filter files by filename
2) Few CSS tweaks
3) Patched to correct https://drupal.org/node/2104493
4) Added permission to enable/disable permission to use username filter

I'm using this module together with Media 7.x-1.4 and it works like a charm! You can also have your media 7.x-1.4 module patched with patches found here:
a) https://drupal.org/node/2104493
b) https://drupal.org/node/2089697

Many thanks to people on cheppers!!! We really need this while we don't have stable Media 7.x-2.x!
