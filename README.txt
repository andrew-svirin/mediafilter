Media filter
============

This module adds a filter form to Media module 7.x-1.x to handle webs with large amount of images

Based on http://cheppers.com/blog/create-custom-browser-widget-media-module

My customization of cheppers code consists of:
1) Brand new text input to filter files by filename
2) Few CSS tweaks

Many thanks to people on cheppers!!! We really need this while we don't have stable Media 7.x-2.x!
